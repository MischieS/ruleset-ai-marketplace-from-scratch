# UI/UX + Business Strategy (Frontend-First)

## Objective
Deliver a top-tier, modern product experience before backend integration by using high-fidelity mock data and production-grade UX architecture.

## Product Surface Map

1. Homepage
- Value proposition and trust signals
- Entry into core journeys
- Business pillar communication

2. Marketplace
- Search/filter/sort
- Product comparison-ready card model
- Sponsored + organic discovery structure

3. User Workspace
- Order visibility
- Lifecycle status clarity
- Support context access

4. Seller Workspace
- Revenue + campaign management
- Promotion budget simulation
- Performance and SLA awareness

5. Admin Workspace
- Payout queue operations
- Risk and governance visibility
- Moderation readiness

## UX Principles
- Clarity over novelty: no heavy, distracting scroll effects.
- Progressive depth: simple first view, advanced controls where needed.
- Signal-rich cards: score + quality + price + trust in one glance.
- Fast interaction loops: feedback under one second for all key actions.
- Accessibility baseline: contrast, keyboard focus, reduced-motion support.

## Business Structure

### Core Engines
- Demand Engine: acquisition and conversion
- Trust Engine: scoring, verification, moderation
- Monetization Engine: marketplace fee + sponsorship
- Retention Engine: usage loops and seller/user lifecycle

### KPI Framework
- Listing to purchase conversion
- Seller retention (30/90 days)
- Marketplace GMV and take rate
- Sponsored slot ROI
- Payout SLA and dispute rate

## Execution Order
1. Perfect page model and design system
2. Validate UX flows with mock personas
3. Instrument interaction analytics in frontend
4. Connect each page to real backend endpoints
5. Add end-to-end tests and release gates

## Exit Criteria for Frontend-First Phase
- Every surface has complete UX states (loading, empty, success, error)
- Business metrics and hierarchy are visible in UI
- Navigation and workflows are coherent for all roles
- Design system is reusable and scalable for future features
